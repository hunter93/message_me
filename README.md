## Ruby version: 2.7.2

## System dependencies

- Ruby: This application requires Ruby version 2.7.2.

- Rails: This application is built with Rails version 5.2.8.

- Database: For development, this application uses SQLite, and for production, it uses PostgreSQL. Make sure to have both installed and configured correctly in your local and production environment respectively.

- Server: This application uses Puma as the application server.

- Redis & Sidekiq: This application uses Redis for in-memory data storage and Sidekiq for background processing. Make sure Redis is installed and running on your system.

- Node.js and Yarn: This application may require a JavaScript runtime like Node.js for compiling JavaScript assets. Yarn is also required for managing JavaScript dependencies. Make sure both are installed in your system.

- Additionally, ensure that the necessary gems are installed by running `bundle install`.

- The above dependencies are for getting the application running. You would also need the following for testing and development:

- Testing: For system tests, this application uses Capybara and Selenium. Ensure you have ChromeDriver installed if you want to run system tests.

- Development: The byebug gem is used for debugging, and the spring and spring-watcher-listen gems are used to speed up development by keeping your application running in the background.
